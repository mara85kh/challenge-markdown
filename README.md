### A short story about myself

On the second day at BeCode building in Charleroi, while coming back from the toilet and entering the work room, I bumped into the glass window and a big boom was heard in the class. My attention was distracted by the beauty of the instance, so I ran into the glass window.

TL, DR

I'm bad at entering room using an open door
